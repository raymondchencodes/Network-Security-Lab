## Baseline Traffic Observation (WAN Interface)

A baseline packet capture was performed on the pfSense WAN interface with no intentional traffic generated.

Observed traffic consisted primarily of ICMP and ICMPv6 packets, including echo requests/replies and neighbor discovery messages. TCP traffic was absent during the capture period, and no abnormal patterns such as port scanning, repeated connection attempts, or high-volume bursts were observed.

This baseline establishes a reference for normal network behavior prior to introducing simulated attack traffic.
